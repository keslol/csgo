1. Create a Folder for SteamCMD (End size is around 32GB)
  - I chose E:/Games/steamcmd
2. Download SteamCMD via https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/steamcmd.zip
3. Extract .zip file to newly created folder
4. Enable File name extensions (In Win10 this is a checkbox in the View Tab of the File explorer)
5. Rightclick in the steamcmd folder  New -> Text file 
6. Insert "steamcmd.exe +force_install_dir ../cs_go +login anonymous +app_update 740 +quit" without quotes and save
7. Exit Notepad and change the extensions from .txt to .bat
8. Open the new file
 - In the meantime visit https://github.com/splewis/csgo-practice-mode and click on the latest Release on the right side (1.3.4 currently)
  - Download the practicmode_1.3.4.zip or whatever version it is
  - Visit https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php?branch=stable and click the Windows Icon 
  - Visit http://www.metamodsource.net/downloads.php?branch=stable and click the Windows Icon

For this section you can just rightclick the console window to paste instead of retyping commands
9. To update the application you can just open the newly created .bat file again
